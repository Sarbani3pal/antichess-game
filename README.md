##AntiChess Game

**--> Welcome to AntiChess, a web-based chess-like game with a twist!**

##Overview
AntiChess is built using React and allows players to enjoy a variant of chess where the objective is to lose all your pieces  (or get stalemated) to win the game.
Antichess is an eccentric variant where you lose all your pieces or get stalemated to win.

In each turn the player should have the option to: 
- Quit ( upon which the other player wins the game ) 
- Move a piece from its current position to any allowed position based on the rules of the game

##Rules of teh game includes:
- Pieces move the same way they do in standard chess; however, kings lose their royal powers - they cannot castle, and checks are no longer a threat.
- Since kings have lost their royal powers, pawns may be promoted to kings.
- Capturing is forced. If you can take a piece, you must. If multiple pieces can be captured, you may choose which piece you capture.
